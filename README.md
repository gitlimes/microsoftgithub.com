# microsoftgithub.com, a.k.a. NotHub

A website that lets you create legit-looking GitHub links that rickroll the visitor.

## Usage
Just replace `github.com` with `microsoftgithub.com`. Yeah, that's all! The resulting url will redirect to the rickroll link.
When embedded on Twitter, Discord and other social sites, the link will display the official social preview, for extra realism.
