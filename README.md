# microsoftgithub.com, a.k.a. NotHub

A website that lets you create official-looking GitHub links that rickroll the visitor. For more info (and statistics), visit [microsoftgithub.com/usage](https://microsoftgithub.com/usage).

Make sure to check out my sibling project, [nintenclo.com](https://nintenclo.com/usage)

## Usage

Simply replace `github.com` with `microsoftgithub.com`. The resulting URL will redirect to the rickroll video, but its social media preview will look identical to the official page.
