# microsoftgithub.com, a.k.a. NotHub

A website that lets you create official-looking GitHub links that rickroll the visitor.

## Usage

Simply replace `github.com` with `microsoftgithub.com`. The resulting URL will redirect to the rickroll video, and its social media preview will look identical to the official one.
